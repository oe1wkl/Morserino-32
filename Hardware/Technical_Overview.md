#Morserino-32 Technical Overview

The Morserino-32 is based on the Heltec WiFi LORA 32 V.2 module (see [http://www.heltec.cn/project/wifi-lora-32/?lang=en]()). This module comes with mayn integrated features, that really build the core of Morserino-32's functionality:

* MCU (ESP32, 240 MHz clock speed), RAM (520 KB SRAM) and Flash Memory (64 MB)
* OLED monochrome graphics display (128x64 pixels)
* USB, Wifi, LoRa and Bluetooth on board (Bluetooth currently not used for the Morserino-32)
* LiPo charging circuit on board

So in fact we only need some periphery to turn this jewel into a multi-functional Morse code device...

####Touch Paddles
As ESP32 MCU already has touch input (we use Pins 2 and 12), we only need to supply the mechanics. Two paddles made from PCB material are connected to the mainboard through PCB edge connectors.

####External Paddles
A 3-pole phone jack offers connectivity to two ESP32 GPIO pins (Pins 32 und 33) that are pulled-up to 3.3 V.


####Audio for Loudspeaker or Headphones
Two output pins of the ESP32 (Pins 22 asn 23) are being used to generate an audio signal with the volume controlled by software: one pin generates a square signal with the desired frequency and 50& duty cycle, another output creates a high frequency signal (32 kHz) with a variable duty cycle. These two signals are mixed with the help of an AND gate made from two discrete transistors (T1 and T2), thus creating a puls-width modulated audio signal, with the resulting signal fed directly into a 60 Ohm loudspeaker. The speaker acts as a cheap low pass filter, thus changing the pulse-width modulation into amplitude modulation. 

For headphone use the speaker is replaced with a resistor (R11)  and the two speakers of the headphone in series, to bring the audio level down to a comfortable level.

This arrangement creates low power audio, but certainly not in WiFi quality (the resulting audio is not a sinus tone, but has pretty strong 2nd, 3rd and 5th harmonics).

####Audio Output (Line-Out)

Another audio output is generated on Pin 17 of the ESP32. This time this is fed through a 3rd order RTC low pass filter with a cut  off fequency around 1000 Hz (R15 - R18, C8 - C11), thus creating an audio signal that is almost a pure sine tone with 700 Hz output (harmonics are at least 24 dB down). This can be used for applications that require a pretty pure sine tone, for example Mumble (used by the CW over Internet protocol - iCW).

####Audio Input
In order to decode Morse signals that are available as audio tones, a single-rail low-voltage operational amplifier (IC1) is being used to amplify the signal sufficiently so that it can be fed into the ESP32's Analog-Digital Converter input (Pin 36). Amplification can be controlled by a trimmer potentiometer (R21).

####Interface to Transmitter
In order to be able to key a transmitter or transceiver, the signal of Pin 25 is controlling a MOSFET opto-coupler (OC1) as a "solid state relay". This achieves complete galvanic insulation from the transmitter, and allows to switch up to 60 V of positive or negative voltage, which means that all modern transmitters or transceivers can be keyed without the need for additional circuitry.

####Rotary Encoder and Push Button Switches
A 24 indent 24 position rotary encoder with integrated push button switch is being used as the primary user interface for the Morserino-32, with RC combinations pulling up the ESP32 input pins (Pins 38 and 39) and at teh same time reducing bouncing.

A second push-button switch is connected to Pin 0 of the ESP32.

####Battery ON/OFF switch and Polyfuse
A LiPo battery is connected to the ESP32's battery charging circuitry through a sliding switch and a 500 mA self-resetting fuse that switches the battery off should there be a short circuit anywhere down the line.

####Serial Port
On the PCB there is a provison for 4 pin headers (to the left of the external paddles connector). Through this connector you can connect external devices through the serial port of the ESP32 (the headers are marked as **R** (Receive), **T** (Transmit), **+** (3.3V) and **-** (ground). R and T are connected to Pins RX and TX of the ESP32, the positive voltage taken from the VEXT pin.

This could be used, for example, to connect a GPS module to the Morserino-32. While this is currently not supported by software, it would be relatively straightforward to create a LoRa APRS beacon.
